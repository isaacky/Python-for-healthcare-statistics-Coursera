# Python-for-healthcare-statistics-Coursera
Files and Colab notebooks for my course on Python for healthcare statistics.

This repository contains the files and notebooks for my YouTube video series on Python for healthcare statistics, which you can find [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsu0TcgLDUiLjvlqlgWlujHvi-kTpVIeo).  This video series follows along with my award winning massive open online course (MOOC) on Coursera called Understanding Clinical Research - Behind the Statsitics.  It is available [HERE](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-research).

The MOOC introduces learners to healthcare statistics in an intuitive way, building understanding of concepts inlcuding data types, study types, sampling, confidence intervals, p-values, odds-ratios, and much more.

The YouTube video series follows along with the topics in the MOOC, but introduces HOW to do the tests using Python.  No installations are reqired, as the video series uses Google Colab (on Google Drive).  Anyone with a Google account can follow along.  It is as sinple to open a notebook as a Google Doc.

I have another MOOC on Coursera which teaches statistics using the Wolfram Language, which is available [Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-research-biostatistics-wolfram).  This course also introduces deep learning using the Wolfram Language.
